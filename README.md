# battleship
Simple battleship game

Concept:
Build a scenario between two players in a battleship game.
Step 1 intialise the players
Step 2 have the players randomly select ships in a 10x10 board.
Step 3 randomly select a player to start.
Step 4 each round players will make random coordinate choices against each other's ships.
Step 5 determine if the defending player has lost after each turn.
Step 6 report the results

To run this project set the Battleship.Console Project as the Start project. When running the console app, it will output the results of the games.

Note: I was so excited to get into this project I didn't properly read the requirements so I started building a front end in angular. The front end is not complete and only
allows players to place their ships.
